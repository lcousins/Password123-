My name is Lucy and I am familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I also have experience with R, Java, and a little bit of Python. I also have experience with GIS (Geographic Information Systems/Science) softwares.
I am an Informatics major, so I also have plenty of experience with Statistics.  I am excited to create a Password Hasher App.
