### About Me
Hello, I'm Jacob, I have an Associate degree in web and mobile development and have been doing full stack development freelance for about 3 years. I am familiar with many frameworks such as Angular, React, Ionic, Electron, and Material. I also have experience with GCP and AWS, along with Auth0 authentication. Outside of web dev I am experienced with Swift, Python, Java, C#, and Dart. I am down for anything really, but I do enjoy working with mapping projects and projects displaying large quantities of data in an interesting and educational manner. I can do frontend or backend and can easily switch between to match the needs of the team.
